# seobytes_livesearch
This is a Wordpress plugin that creates a live product search with product categories and product attributes filters.
The filters as well as the live results appear as a drop down under the search input field of the WordPress search widget.
The search widget is better placed in central position in the header.
You might need to modify the id of the search filters in the code for the dropdown to display.
